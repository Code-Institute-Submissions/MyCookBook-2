# [My CookBook](https://mycookbook-project.herokuapp.com/)
"My CookBook" - Practical Python and Data-Centric Development Milestone Project.

The main purpose of this full-stack MongoDB-based Flask project is to create a database of recipes that allows users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) recipes.
"My CookBook" gives access to all recipes in the database for non-registered users. At the same time it gives the opportunity to create an account and benifit from having convenient access to all features of the website.
Registered users can add new recipes, edit and delete their own ones, as well as edit their username and password or delete account. 

["My CookBook"](https://mycookbook-project.herokuapp.com/) is a simple way to view, create and store your recipies! Sign in, get inspired, contribute, cook and enjoy!

## UX
My main goal in UX was to built a website minimalistic in design, simple to use; where users can create their own recipes, view all recipes created by others,
edit and delete their recipes. The target audience for this app is anyone who has passion for cooking, wants to discover new recipes or needs to store their own recipes online.
Creating modern, sleek and user-friendly interface with easy access to all information is the key to giving users feel of reliability, security and positiveness. 
With this in mind, I developed this app in a way that everyone can view all the recipes on the website, while only authors can make changes to their recipes. 
As well as that, structuring the website in well-organised readable way with easy navigation was another goal for this project.
### User Stories
**As a user, I want/expect:**
- to view all the recipes without having to register
- to view all recipes details (including cuisine, meal and diet types, cooking time, servings, list of ingredients and directions)
- to see how many recipes are in the website
- to create my own account
- to add new recipes 
- to edit my recipes 
- to view a list of my recipes on a separate page and see how many recipes I've created
- to delete my recipes
- to log out any time and have the session terminated
- to change my current username
- to change my current password
- to delete my account and all recipes I've created
- to use the website from any device(laptop, tablet, mobile)
