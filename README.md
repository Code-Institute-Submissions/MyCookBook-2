# [My CookBook](https://mycookbook-project.herokuapp.com/)
"My CookBook" - Practical Python and Data-Centric Development Milestone Project.

The main purpose of this full-stack MongoDB-backed Flask project is to create a database of recipes that allows users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) recipes.
"My CookBook" gives access to all recipes in the database for non-registered users, while it gives the opportunity to create an account and benifit of having convenient access to all features of the website.
Registered users can add new recipes, edit and delete their own recipes, as well as edit their username and password or delete account. 

[**"My CookBook"**](https://mycookbook-project.herokuapp.com/) is a simple way to find, create and store your recipies! Sign in, create your own, get inspired, cook and enjoy!
